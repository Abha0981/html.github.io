                The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in
                Vishwanath Gali of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh in India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy
                river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is
                known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara or Vishveshvur) literally
                meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi was called Kashi ("shining") in ancient times, and hence the
                temple is popularly called Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

                The temple is considered a central part of worship in the Shaiva culture by Hindu scriptures. It had
                been demolished by many Muslim rulers many times, most recently by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor
                who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site.[1] The current structure was built on an adjacent site
                by the Maratha ruler, Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore in the year 1780.[2]

                Since 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh.

                Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the
                field') is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located in the Garhwal Himalayan range near
                the Mandakini river in Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the
                general public only between April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the full autumn moon).
                During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for
                the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the
                region's historical name.[1]
                The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek
                from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan services are available to reach the temple. According to Hindu
                legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the
                holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[2] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in
                Kedarnath.[3][2] The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of the
                Northern Himalayas. It is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest
                among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] <br><br>It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams expounded in the
                Tevaram. It is a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called
                Nayanars. This temple is sung by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram
                texts.[5]
                Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex,
                surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage. Still, the temple structure did not
                suffer any significant damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls caused by the
                flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting
                the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily
                damaged.[6]
